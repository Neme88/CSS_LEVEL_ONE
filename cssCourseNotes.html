    <h3>CSS Level Part One</h3>
    <p>In this session we will cover the basics of CSS and how to link CSS file to our HTML file</p>
    <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML</p>
    <h3>Example below is how to link CSS file to an html file</h3>
    <code>
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="part1_master.css"&gt;
    </code>
    <p> In this example the link tag and its rel attribute is used to define that we are linking a CSS file while the href is use input the path to the css file it can be relative or absolute path depending on the location of the cs file in the machine.</p>
    <p>When your CSS  file is properly link to html file all the styling changes you make in the css file reflect on the tags targeted </p>
    <p>You can also style your html directly in the same file which is called inline styling however the best practice is to have a separate file for css code this for modularity</p>

    <P>Comment in CSS is used to add more readability in for the developer who is working on the code bass the when properly implemented the machine jumps of comment which means that comments gets ignored by the machine</P>
    <h3>Example of comment in CSS</h3>

      /* This is a comment in CSS */
    </code>
    <h3>CSS General form </h3>
    <p>CSS rules are defined by selectors and declarations</p>
